      <description>The newest game release from miHoYo has proven to be the bane of my productivity, but in a good way. It has been a lengthy time since I have been as invested into a video game as I am into Zenless Zone Zero.

      <description>My name is Matija Milaković. I&amp;rsquo;ve started my professional journey in the games industry in 2022, studying Game Development at the University of Skövde in Sweden. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on a variety of projects in multiple roles, but mainly as a gameplay programmer. I also love Warhammer 40k, horror movies and games, anime and brisk walks in nature while brandishing my favorite Casio watches.&#xA;Right now I am working on an FPS called Gun Samurai - a class-based competitive first-person shooter.</description>
