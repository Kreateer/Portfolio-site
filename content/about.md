My name is Matija Milaković. I've started my professional journey in the games industry in 2022, studying Game Development at the University of Skövde in Sweden. I've worked on a variety of projects in multiple roles, but mainly as a gameplay programmer. I also love Warhammer 40k, horror movies and games, anime and brisk walks in nature while brandishing my favorite Casio watches.

Right now I am working on an FPS called Gun Samurai - a class-based competitive first-person shooter. At the time of this writing, an early prototype of Gun Samurai is in development.

If there's one thing I keep re-learning with every new project, it's that game development is difficult. It can also be boring. Even soul crushing. However, it can also be the most satisfying job in existance. After all, there is nothing that compares to someone playing what you've poured your heart and soul into and watching them enjoy it.
